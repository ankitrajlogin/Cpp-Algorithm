/*
Multidimensional arrays in C++ are arrays of arrays, meaning they contain elements that are themselves arrays. You can also use pointers to work with these arrays, and understanding how pointers relate to multidimensional arrays is essential for more complex data manipulations.

Multidimensional Arrays
A multidimensional array is essentially an array of arrays. The most common type is a 2D array (matrix), but you can have arrays with more dimensions (e.g., 3D, 4D, etc.).
